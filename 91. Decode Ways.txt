Dynamic Programming
One-dimension array (string size + 1), first unit equals to 1
For each bit, check if it's '0'. If so, assign this bit of dp to 0; if not, assign previous dp value
Then check the previous bit, if exists, non-zero and smaller than 26 when combined with current bit, add the one before previous dp value to current dp
