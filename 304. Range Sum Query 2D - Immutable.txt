Extension of 303. Range Sum Query - Immutable
Build a 2-D array dp to accumulate addition, in which dp[i][j] means sum of all numbers from (0,0) to (i,j)
Then sumRange(r1, c1, r2, c2) = dp[r2][c2] - dp[r2][c1-1] - dp[r1-1][c2] + dp[r1-1][c1-1]
Time Complexity: O(n^2) for NumArray, O(1) for sumRange
