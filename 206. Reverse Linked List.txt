Solution 1: iterative
Create a dummy node before the linked list, then begin with head node, move each node to dummy->next
Repeat until head becomes the last node

Solution 2: recursive
Dive into recursive function until head points to the last node and p points to the previous one
then change p and head's positions, and return to the last layer of recursion
After each switch, nodes after head are already ordered, until p becomes the first node
