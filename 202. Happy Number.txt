If a number isn't happy, then it will enter a loop without 1
Example: 11
1^2 + 1^2 = 2
2^2 = 4
4^2 = 16
1^2 + 6^2 = 37
3^2 + 7^2 = 58
5^2 + 8^2 = 89
8^2 + 9^2 = 145
1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 42
4^2 + 2^2 = 20
2^2 + 0^2 = 4
4 appears again in the last line
Use vector to record numbers appeared, for each new number, check if it's in the set
If so, break and judge if it's 1, if so, return true; if not, return false
else add the new number into the vector
