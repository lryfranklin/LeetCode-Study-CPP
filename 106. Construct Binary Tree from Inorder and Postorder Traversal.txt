Depth-First Search
The last node in postorder traversal is always the root of the tree and node with the same value in inorder traversal breaks it into left and right parts.
According to lengths of left and right parts in inorder traversal, breaks the rest of postorder traversal nodes into left and right parts.
Repeat the above process for each left and right part.
