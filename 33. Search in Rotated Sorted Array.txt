Binary Search Method
Difficulty: don't know where is the array rotated
Key: Search left half or right half after obtaining the middle number

0  1  2  4  5  6  7

7  0  1  2  4  5  6

6  7  0  1  2  4  5

5  6  7  0  1  2  4

4  5  6  7  0  1  2

2  4  5  6  7  0  1

1  2  4  5  6  7  0

From the above, we obtain the following:
(i). if the middle number is smaller than the very right one, then right half is sorted
(ii). if the middle number is larger than the very right one, then left half is sorted
then check if target is in the sorted half to confirm which half to search in the next step
