1. There is 1 stone, first turn takes all, WIN FOR FIRST;
2. There are 2 stones, first turn takes all, WIN FOR FIRST;
3. There are 3 stones, first turn takes all, WIN FOR FIRST;
4. There are 4 stones, second turn faces any of the above 3 situations, WIN FOR SECOND;
5. There are 5 stones, first turn takes 1 and second turn has situation 4, WIN FOR FIRST;
6. There are 6 stones, first turn takes 2 and second turn has situation 4, WIN FOR FIRST......
