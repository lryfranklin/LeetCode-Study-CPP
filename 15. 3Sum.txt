Solution 1: shorter
Sort the array (O(n)), then traverse the sorted array (O(n))
For each element, use value of 0 - element to be the target value 
Search in rest of the array to find two numbers that have a sum of target
Pay attention to skip duplicate element(s) when traversing/searching

Solution 2: longer, easier
Use the feature of set, which is cannot contain duplicate elements/tuples, to avoid generting duplicate tuples
