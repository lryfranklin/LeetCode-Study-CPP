Solution 1:
1 - 1
2 - 10
4 - 100
8 - 1000
16 - 10000......
Numbers that are power of two have only one 1 in their binary expressions. Thus, determine number of 1s can help decide whether the number is a power of two.

Solution 2:
According to Solution 1, numbers that are power of two only have one 1 in their highest bit, with all other bits 0.
If the number is deducted by 1, then all bits that are 0 will be 1 and vice versa. AND operation between the two numbers will be 0.
