Depth-First Search Recursion
Use variable left and right to represent number of remain left and right parentheses 
Three situations to consider:
(i). if left > right, meaning that current right parentheses generated are more than left parentheses, which is illegal, return
(ii). if left and right are both 0, then all parentheses are generated correctly, save the string
(iii). otherwise, if left is larger than 0, call recursive function with left-1; if right is larger than 0, call recursive function with right-1
