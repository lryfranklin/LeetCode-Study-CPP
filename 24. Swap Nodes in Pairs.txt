Basic linked list manipulation problem

Solution 1: Iteration
Create a dummy node before head node (key)
Had better draw a graph when linking nodes together

Solution 2: Recursion
Use backtracking method, traverse to the end of the linked list, start to swap from the last two nodes, then move forward to previous nodes
