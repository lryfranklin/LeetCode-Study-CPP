I -> 1
V -> 5
X -> 10
L -> 50
C -> 100
D -> 500
M -> 1000
Consecutive numbers equals the summation of these numbers. Exp. III = 3
Smaller numbers are to the right of larger numbers equal to the summation of these numbers. Exp. VIII = 8
Smaller numbers (I, X, C only) are to the left of larger numbers equal to larger numbers minus smaller numbers. Exp. IV = 4

Two situations to consider:
1. If current number is the last one OR the follwing number is smaller, add this number
2. Otherwise minus this number
